The Bankist App is a simple yet interactive web application that simulates the user interface of a modern bank's main page. Designed primarily for educational and demonstration purposes, it provides users with a realistic banking experience. Within the app, users can log in to their accounts, view detailed records of their transactions—including money deposits ("in") and withdrawals ("out")—and perform key banking actions. These include requesting a loan, transferring money to another account, and even closing their account. While the app does not connect to any real banking systems, it offers a hands-on way to understand how core banking features work from a front-end perspective.
